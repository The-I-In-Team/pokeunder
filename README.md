# Pokémon: Unedrground Version

NOTE: What this README says is not reflective of the current state of Pokémon: Underground Version. This states everything that the game will eventually be. See the changelog to see what has actually been implemented in full.

Pokémon: Underground Version is a Generation 3 Pokémon fangame based on the source code of Pokémon: Emerald Version. The premise of this game is to reimagine the 2015 RPG UNDERTALE as if it was a 2004 Pokémon game. 

## Story (Spoilers)

The story is largely carried over from UNDERTALE, but adapted to the new world it takes place in.

The region of Ebott has had a complex history. In the modern day, only pokémon which have migrated from other regions can be found. However, long ago, this was not the case.
It used to have a multitude of its own species. But one day, for reasons unknown, the humans and pokémon in this area turned against eachother, sparking years of war. Eventually, humanity proved victorious, and used seven of their greatest magicians to seal their enemies under the mountain in the center of the region.

Over the years, seven trainers have went into this C, either by accident, or to find one of the many species that only could be found down there. None of them have been seen again. Now, it's up to you to go to Mt. Ebott and see what lies below. What happenss after that is up to you.

## Gameplay

The overworld sections of Pokémon Underground plays like Generation 3 Pokémon. Press A to interact, press B to run, use the Directional Pad to move around, and press START to pause.

There are two stat systems in this game. Pokémon stats and trainer stats. Pokémon stats can be seen just like in other Pokémon games, from the POKéMON menu. Trainer stats can be viewed by looking at your trainer card. (The option in the pause menu that says your filename). These stats are entirely disconnected.

Pokémon stats are mostly the as Emerald, and thus I will not go into detail on them here.
It is important to note, however, that the acronym for Experience Points has been changed from EXP to XP.

Trainer stats are as followed.:
HP - How much health you have.
MAX - Your maximum HP.
LOVE - This is the same stat as Undertale's LV stat, Level of Violence. The longer acronym is always used to not be confused with pokémon Level stat, LV.
EXP - Execution Points.
ATK - Attack.
DEF - Defence.

## Battles

Battles in Pokémon Underground go as follows.

The player sends out their main Pokémon, and has four options:
FIGHT, BAG, POKéMON, RUN.
When you FIGHT, you have an option of four moves you can do, each with their own PP, Accuracy, and Power.
BAG allows you to use any item you have collected on your journey.
POKéMON allows you to swap your active party member. (Unless your battle mode is SET.)
RUN allows you to flee from Pokémon. You cannot run from every battle.

Depending on SPEED, either you or your opponent will go first. When your opponent goes, one of three things will happen.
If your opponent has a blue attack indicator, it will attack your active pokémon. In this case, regular battle rules apply.
If your opponent has an orange attack indicator, it will attack you. In this case, your soul enters a Bullet Board. In this case, UNDERTALE rules apply.
If your opponent has a grey indicator, you can choose.

When your opponent faints, you have two options. FIGHT, or MERCY. If you select FIGHT, you send your Active Pokémon to attack the fainted opponent. You will gain EXP, and extra XP. Your Active Pokémon will have their Friendship reduced slightly. If you select MERCY, the battle ends as normal, and you are awarded XP.

There are two ways to lose a battle. If all of your Pokémon's HP reaches 0, you will white out, and get sent back to the last SAVE point while keeping any progress you made. If your HP reaches 0, you die, and get sent back to the last SAVE point without any of the progress you made.

## Friendship

Friendship works a little differently in Pokémon Underground. If your Friendship is too low, a Pokémon might not listen to you, with chances as low as 25%.
The cap on the Friendship value depends on your LOVE. The higher your LOVE, the lower the cap will be.
